# Zombie - Finder

An progressive game application can play offline too.

### How to play

>Before you jump into this, you need to know how the game actually works.
Contrary to popular belief, it's actually quite simply. Click a square, you get a number. That number is the number of how many mines are surrounding it. If you find the mine, you can open "unopened" squares around it, opening more areas.
